# I-Am-Rich
<br><br>
Let me tell you a story...<br>
Earlier, there was an app named I Am Rich on Apple AppStore which literally did nothing.<br>
The developer created this app to prove that the users are rich.<br>
He kept the price of the app maximum which is allowed by AppStore i.e. $999.99<br>
7 users bought the app!!!<br>
<br>
Here's a similar app that does nothing!<br>
